Welcome! Let's start your handover process. I'll guide you through documenting your projects, tasks, and resources.
Here are the key areas we'll cover:
1. Your projects and their descriptions.
2. Key documents such as kickoff materials or strategy docs.
3. Tasks: urgent and important tasks, stakeholders, timelines, and links (e.g., Jira, Google Sheets).
4. Critical information or gotchas related to tasks or projects.
5. Additional documents or resources.
